Why Database Technology Matters

 

Forget SQL. Forget network, document or object databases. Forget the relational algebra. Forget schemas. Forget joins and normalization. Forget ACID. Forget Map/Reduce.

Think knowledge representation. Think knowledge collection, transformation, aggregation, sharing. Think knowledge discovery.

Think of humanity and its collective mind expanding.
