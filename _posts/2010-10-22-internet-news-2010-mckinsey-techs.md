前面列了一些互联网方面的创业公司，现在该说一下互联网目前的发展的总体趋势。

觉得Mckinsey的十大商业发展趋势说的不错，一下是相关内容转载：

到底什么才tech-enabled business（粗粗翻译的意思是IT支持下的商业模式）？什么才是最被看好的呢？

麦肯锡季刊的这篇文章给出了Top 10，原文点这里：

    Trend 1: Distributed cocreation moves into the mainstream
    Trend 2: Making the network the organization
    Trend 3: Collaboration at scale
    Trend 4: The growing ‘Internet of Things’
    Trend 5: Experimentation and big data
    Trend 6: Wiring for a sustainable world
    Trend 7: Imagining anything as a service
    Trend 8: The age of the multisided business model
    Trend 9: Innovating from the bottom of the pyramid
    Trend 10: Producing public good on the grid

每个理念的分析之后还给出了相关书籍阅读的参考！希望大家一起找到下一个金矿。

1. Distributed cocreation moves into the mainstream

分布式协作的先驱就是wikipedia和开源软件的开发者们了。而现在这样的互动模式渐渐成为business practice的主流了。

公司们以此来降低服务用户的成本和扩大范围。比如host一个客户服务的社区，有经验的客户还可以直接给新手们些建议。据估计，用户社区在处理一个问题的成本比传统的call centre低10％。

公司们还以此来做口碑营销（ word-of-mouth marketing）。比如宝洁的 P&G’s Vocalpoint network of influential mothers。

Facebook甚至利用社区的力量来完成产品开发，最近30万名用户被招募来将facebook翻译成70种语言——翻译成法语竟然只花了1天时间。.

2. Making the network the organization

让组织成为一张开放的网，在组织内部能够打破地域、部门、业务的边界；在组织外部，让非雇员也为组织做出贡献——这一现象被称为“tapping into a world of talent.”——比如利用互联网技术使得公司的研发部门可以access全世界的专家。

组织的结构正在剧烈的变化、升级。

Dow Chemical就自己建立了一个talent的network，将以前的雇员，比如退休人员都囊括进来。

Amazon.com的Mechanical Turk就是一个在线的labor market；Innocentive 和Zooppa则利用企业外部的资源来为企业提供内容服务。

从长远来看，网络式的组织将不再关注工人们的归属问题，而关注一项任务的协力执行。

3. Collaboration at scale

Across many economies, the number of people who undertake knowledge work has grown much more quickly than the number of production or transactions workers. Knowledge workers typically are paid more than others, so increasing their productivity is critical. As a result, there is broad interest in collaboration technologies that promise to improve these workers’ efficiency and effectiveness. While the body of knowledge around the best use of such technologies is still developing, a number of companies have conducted experiments, as we see in the rapid growth rates of video and Web conferencing, expected to top 20 percent annually during the next few years.

Back to top4. The growing ‘Internet of Things’

The adoption of RFID (radio-frequency identification) and related technologies was the basis of a trend we first recognized as “expanding the frontiers of automation.” But these methods are rudimentary compared with what emerges when assets themselves become elements of an information system, with the ability to capture, compute, communicate, and collaborate around information—something that has come to be known as the “Internet of Things.” Embedded with sensors, actuators, and communications capabilities, such objects will soon be able to absorb and transmit information on a massive scale and, in some cases, to adapt and react to changes in the environment automatically. These “smart” assets can make processes more efficient, give products new capabilities, and spark novel business models. 6

5. Experimentation and big data

Could the enterprise become a full-time laboratory? What if you could analyze every transaction, capture insights from every customer interaction, and didn’t have to wait for months to get data from the field? What if . . . ? Data are flooding in at rates never seen before—doubling every 18 months—as a result of greater access to customer data from public, proprietary, and purchased sources, as well as new information gathered from Web communities and newly deployed smart assets. These trends are broadly known as “big data.” Technology for capturing and analyzing information is widely available at ever-lower price points. But many companies are taking data use to new levels, using IT to support rigorous, constant business experimentation that guides decisions and to test new products, business models, and innovations in customer experience. In some cases, the new approaches help companies make decisions in real time. This trend has the potential to drive a radical transformation in research, innovation, and marketing.

6. Wiring for a sustainable world

Even as regulatory frameworks continue to evolve, environmental stewardship and sustainability clearly are C-level agenda topics. What’s more, sustainability is fast becoming an important corporate-performance metric—one that stakeholders, outside influencers, and even financial markets have begun to track. Information technology plays a dual role in this debate: it is both a significant source of environmental emissions and a key enabler of many strategies to mitigate environmental damage. At present, information technology’s share of the world’s environmental footprint is growing because of the ever-increasing demand for IT capacity and services. Electricity produced to power the world’s data centers generates greenhouse gases on the scale of countries such as Argentina or the Netherlands, and these emissions could increase fourfold by 2020. McKinsey research has shown, however, that the use of IT in areas such as smart power grids, efficient buildings, and better logistics planning could eliminate five times the carbon emissions that the IT industry produces.

7. Imagining anything as a service

Technology now enables companies to monitor, measure, customize, and bill for asset use at a much more fine-grained level than ever before. Asset owners can therefore create services around what have traditionally been sold as products. Business-to-business (B2B) customers like these service offerings because they allow companies to purchase units of a service and to account for them as a variable cost rather than undertake large capital investments. Consumers also like this “paying only for what you use” model, which helps them avoid large expenditures, as well as the hassles of buying and maintaining a product.

8. The age of the multisided business model

Multisided business models create value through interactions among multiple players rather than traditional one-on-one transactions or information exchanges. In the media industry, advertising is a classic example of how these models work. Newspapers, magazines, and television stations offer content to their audiences while generating a significant portion of their revenues from third parties: advertisers. Other revenue, often through subscriptions, comes directly from consumers. More recently, this advertising-supported model has proliferated on the Internet, underwriting Web content sites, as well as services such as search and e-mail (see trend number seven, “Imagining anything as a service,” earlier in this article). It is now spreading to new markets, such as enterprise software: Spiceworks offers IT-management applications to 950,000 users at no cost, while it collects advertising from B2B companies that want access to IT professionals.

9. Innovating from the bottom of the pyramid

The adoption of technology is a global phenomenon, and the intensity of its usage is particularly impressive in emerging markets. Our research has shown that disruptive business models arise when technology combines with extreme market conditions, such as customer demand for very low price points, poor infrastructure, hard-to-access suppliers, and low cost curves for talent. With an economic recovery beginning to take hold in some parts of the world, high rates of growth have resumed in many developing nations, and we’re seeing companies built around the new models emerging as global players. Many multinationals, meanwhile, are only starting to think about developing markets as wellsprings of technology-enabled innovation rather than as traditional manufacturing hubs.

10. Producing public good on the grid

The role of governments in shaping global economic policy will expand in coming years.7 Technology will be an important factor in this evolution by facilitating the creation of new types of public goods while helping to manage them more effectively. This last trend is broad in scope and draws upon many of the other trends described above.

The pace of technology and business change will only accelerate, and the impact of the trends above will broaden and deepen. For some organizations, they will unlock significant competitive advantages; for others, dealing with the disruption they bring will be a major challenge. Our broad message is that organizations should incorporate an understanding of the trends into their strategic thinking to help identify new market opportunities, invent new ways of doing business, and compete with an ever-growing number of innovative rivals.
